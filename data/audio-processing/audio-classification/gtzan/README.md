### üÜî Track IDs and Sequences

The audio tracks are named with a convention based on their genre and an ID number. The files are arranged sequentially by genre, as follows:

<table style="margin:0 auto; border: 1px solid;">
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th rowspan="2">File Naming Sequence</th>
      <th colspan="10" style="text-align: center;">Genres</th>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <th style="text-align: center;">Blues</th>
      <th style="text-align: center;">Classical</th>

### üìä Dataset Usage

The GTZAN dataset is often used in machine learning and deep learning projects for:

- **Music Genre Classification**: Identifying the genre of a music track based on audio features.
- **Feature Extraction**: Evaluating which features best represent musical styles and genres.
- **Model Evaluation**: Comparing the performance of different machine learning models in the classification task.

## üì• Access the Dataset

- The GTZAN dataset is not directly included in this repository due to its size **[~1.3 GB]**.
- You can download the dataset from the following link:
  - [**kaggle.com/datasets/andradaolteanu/gtzan-dataset-music-genre-classification**](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/andradaolteanu/gtzan-dataset-music-genre-classification)
- ‚ö†Ô∏è **Known Issues**:
  - `jazz.00054.wav` is **corrupted**, make sure to **skip** or **replace** it with [**this**](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1ReErUq7w1T_FOkJqBsjFhOlpbw1ukiG8/view?usp=sharing) one (thanks to [*R√©mi Mignot*](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/andradaolteanu/gtzan-dataset-music-genre-classification/discussion/158649#1860479) üëè) when loading the dataset from above link.
  - The labels don‚Äôt seem to be **100%** correct which makes the 100%-accuracy models **questionable** [[link](https://music-classification.github.io/tutorial/part2_basics/dataset.html#gtzan-music-genre-2002)].
  - There are heavy artist **repetition**, which are very often **ignored** during dataset split [[link](https://music-classification.github.io/tutorial/part2_basics/dataset.html#gtzan-music-genre-2002)].
- üìÇ **Dataset Splits**
  - this repository includes **predefined dataset splits** inside the [splits/](./splits/) folder adapted from [this repository](https://github.com/coreyker/dnn-mgr/tree/master/gtzan).
  - **Filtered Split** removes known duplicates, mislabeled tracks, and corrupted files to prevent data leakage and improve evaluation reliability.
  - **Stratified Split** Ensures genre balance while keeping the dataset structure similar to the original. Faulty samples are still present.
- ‚úçÔ∏è **Notes**:
  - If the equality of audio lengths is important to you, **not** all the audio files have the **exact** same length.
  - **Most** of the audio files e.g., `blues.00000.wav`, have a length of 30.01 seconds (which can be considered a **"valid length"**).
  - **Some** of the audio files e.g., `classical.00042.wav`, are **longer** than usual (and needs to be **clipped**).
  - **Some** of the audio files e.g., `classical.00051.wav`, are **shorter** than usual (and needs to be **padded**).

### üìÑ Contents within the Dataset

- **genres_original/**
  - This folder contains the 1,000 audio tracks arranged by genre.
  - Each genre has 100 tracks, and the audio files are named following the pattern `genre.00000.wav` to `genre.00099.wav`.
- **images_original/**
  - This folder contains a set of **Mel spectrogram images** (in PNG format) corresponding to each audio file in the **genres_original/** folder.
  - These images can be used for machine learning tasks such as **image-based** genre classification.
- **features_30_sec.csv**
  - this CSV file contains extracted features over the entire **30-second** length of each audio track.
  - It includes features like **spectral contrast**, **zero-crossing rate**, and **Mel-frequency cepstral coefficients (MFCCs)** for each audio clip.
- **features_3_sec.csv**
  - This CSV file contains extracted features from the audio tracks, computed over **3-second** windows.
  - It includes features like **spectral contrast**, **zero-crossing rate**, and **Mel-frequency cepstral coefficients (MFCCs)** for each audio clip.
